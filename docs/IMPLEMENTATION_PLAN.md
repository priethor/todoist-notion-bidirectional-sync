# Implementation Plan: Complete Todoist-Notion Synchronization

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation plan for bidirectional synchronization between Todoist and Notion, including both tasks and projects following the PARA method design.

## Scope

**What we're building:**
- Full webhook-based sync from Todoist to Notion
- Task synchronization (create, update, complete, delete)
- Project synchronization (Todoist projects â†’ Notion Areas)
- Soft deletion with audit trails
- PARA method integration with proper relational structure

**What's out of scope (for now):**
- Notion â†’ Todoist sync (future enhancement)
- Real-time conflict resolution
- Bulk historical data migration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Documentation & Database Setup âš¡ CURRENT PHASE

**Goals:** Complete project documentation and database schema design

**Tasks:**
- âœ… Create comprehensive implementation plan documentation
- ðŸ”„ Add project events to Todoist events documentation  
- ðŸ”„ Update design document with expanded database schema
- ðŸ”„ Create step-by-step Notion database setup guide
- ðŸ”„ Create environment configuration template

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (this document)
- Updated `docs/TODOIST_EVENTS.md` with project events
- Updated `docs/DESIGN.md` with Areas database schema
- `NOTION_SETUP.md` with database creation walkthrough
- `.env.template` with all required environment variables

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete documentation for both task and project events
- Clear database schema with all required properties
- Step-by-step setup instructions for new users

### Phase 2: Core Task Synchronization

**Goals:** Implement basic task sync functionality

**Core Components:**
- Database query implementation
- Task lifecycle management  
- Property mapping between systems

**Tasks:**

- Implement `create_task()` with full property mapping
- Implement `update_task()` with conflict detection
- Implement `complete_task()` & `uncomplete_task()` methods
- Implement `delete_task()` with soft deletion strategy

**Property Mapping:**
- Todoist priorities (1-4) â†’ Notion Select ("Normal", "Low", "Medium", "High")
- Due dates with timezone conversion
- Labels â†’ Notion multi-select
- Todoist metadata storage (project_id, user_id, etc.)

**Success Criteria:**
- All 5 task event types process successfully
- Tasks created in Notion with correct properties
- Soft deletion implemented with audit trail
- Error handling prevents data loss

### Phase 3: Project/Area Synchronization  

**Goals:** Implement project sync and task-area relationships

**Core Components:**

- Relational data management

**Tasks:**
- Create `NotionAreasClient` class for project operations
- Implement area CRUD operations (`create_area`, `update_area`, `delete_area`)
- Add project event handlers (`project:added`, `project:updated`, `project:deleted`)
- Implement task-area relationship management
- Handle orphaned tasks when projects are deleted

**Database Relations:**
- Tasks â†’ Areas via Notion relation property
- Automatic relationship updates when projects change
- Proper handling of project archival/restoration

**Success Criteria:**
- Todoist projects automatically create Notion Areas
- Tasks properly linked to their Areas
- Project changes propagate to related tasks
- Project deletion handled gracefully

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Resilience

**Goals:** Production-ready error handling and data integrity

**Core Components:**
- Comprehensive error handling
- Data validation
- Conflict resolution

**Tasks:**
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add rate limiting compliance
- Create data validation for required fields
- Handle malformed webhook payloads
- Implement timestamp-based conflict detection
- Add graceful degradation when services unavailable

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Log all API failures with context
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
- Maintain data consistency during partial failures

**Success Criteria:**
- System recovers gracefully from API failures
- No data loss during error conditions
- Proper logging for debugging and monitoring
- Rate limits respected automatically

### Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance

**Goals:** Comprehensive testing and documentation validation

**Testing Strategy:**
- Integration testing with real Notion workspace
- Error scenario testing and recovery
- Performance testing with multiple concurrent events
- End-to-end workflow validation

**Tasks:**
- Test complete webhook-to-Notion flow
- Test all event types (tasks + projects)
- Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Performance testing with burst events
- Documentation accuracy validation

**Success Criteria:**
- All webhook events process correctly
- Error recovery works as designed  
- Performance meets acceptable thresholds
- Setup documentation is accurate and complete

## Technical Architecture

### Environment Variables

```env
# Notion API Configuration
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_xxx                    # Notion integration token
NOTION_TASK_DATABASE_ID=database_id_xxx      # Tasks database ID
NOTION_AREAS_DATABASE_ID=database_id_xxx     # Areas database ID

# Todoist API Configuration  
TODOIST_CLIENT_SECRET=client_secret_xxx      # Webhook signature verification
TODOIST_API_TOKEN=token_xxx                  # API access (future use)

# Application Configuration
PORT=5000                                    # Flask server port
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                              # Logging verbosity
```

### Database Schema

**Tasks Database Properties:**

- **Priority** (Select): "Normal", "Low", "Medium", "High"
- **Due Date** (Date): Due date with timezone handling
- **Description** (Rich Text): Task description/notes
- **Area** (Relation): Link to Areas database
- **Todoist ID** (Rich Text): Unique task identifier  
- **Todoist Project ID** (Rich Text): Original project reference
- **Last Synced** (Date): Timestamp of last sync
- **Deleted** (Checkbox): Soft delete flag
- **Deleted At** (Date): Deletion timestamp
- **Deleted By** (Select): "Todoist", "Notion"

**Areas Database Properties:**

### Event Processing Flow

**Task Events:**
1. Webhook received â†’ Signature verified
2. Extract task data from payload
3. Query Notion for existing task by Todoist ID
4. Create/update/delete task in Notion
5. Update task-area relationships
6. Log operation and return status

**Project Events:**
1. Webhook received â†’ Signature verified  
2. Extract project data from payload
3. Query Notion for existing area by Todoist Project ID
4. Create/update/delete area in Notion
5. Update related task relationships
6. Log operation and return status

## Risk Mitigation

**API Rate Limits:**
- Implement request throttling
- Use exponential backoff for retries
- Monitor API usage patterns

**Data Consistency:**
- Soft deletion prevents data loss
- Audit trails for all operations
- Timestamp-based conflict resolution

**Service Availability:**
- Graceful degradation when Notion unavailable
- Queue failed operations for retry
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

- Environment variable management for secrets
- HTTPS-only communication

## Success Metrics

**Functional Metrics:**
- 100% of webhook events process successfully
- < 5 second average processing time per event
- Zero data loss during normal operations
- 99.9% uptime for webhook endpoint

**Quality Metrics:**
